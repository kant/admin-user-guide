# Troubleshoot importing and exporting

#### I imported my XML file and Iâ€™m getting an error message.  

Did you validate your XML file before importing it?  If you did not, run it through a validator in your XML editor or browser and the validator will indicate what is wrong with the file.  


#### When I click on the Export button I get a blank page instead of a list of data to export.

You should check the error\_log file to find what went wrong exactly.
