# Data Import and Export

Open Journal Systems offers a variety of tools and Import/Export plugins which allow the Journal Manager to inject data into and extract data from OJS. More information can be found for each plugin's documentation within OJS' plugin directory \(plugins/\).

Import/export functionality is also available as a command-line tool; see tools/importExport.php and the command line section for more information.
