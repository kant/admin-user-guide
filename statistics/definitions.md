# Definitions

In order to best use this document, it is necessary to understand the following definitions as they relate to Open Journal Systems \(OJS\).

* **Abstract page:** the landing page for an article, containing the title, author information, abstract, DOI, and links to any article full-text galleys.  Also known as the “article page” or “landing page”. This page is normally used as the point of record for the article for DOIs or other hyperlinks: Crossref DOIs resolve to article abstract pages, as opposed to galley files, for example, as would most other indexing services.
* **Article view:** within the statistics framework, any reference to an “article view” means a single, unique view of the article abstract page by a visitor. This is not an aggregate count of all article and galley views - it refers to abstract views only.
* **Galley view:** within the statistics framework, any reference to a “galley view” means a single, unique view or download of the a specific galley file by a visitor. Also known as a “galley download”. This is not an aggregate count of all galley views - if there are multiple galleys for an article \(eg. an HTML file, a PDF file, etc.\), each will have its own unique galley view count. OJS does not distinguish between galley downloads and views in the metrics table; downloads are counted as galley views.
* **Multi-clicks:** the process \(accidental or nefarious\) of increasing usage counts by clicking on an abstract page or galley file multiple times in quick succession. OJS identifies and removes these attempts from its usage metrics, as per the Project COUNTER Code of Practice.
* **Project COUNTER Code of Practice:** a set of practices developed by COUNTER to establish a means to report on usage metrics for electronic resources in a consistent way. The Code provides rules on what should be counted as a view, including specific rules for robot usage and multi-click abuse. OJS filters metrics through these rules. It should also be noted that PKP is part of the COUNTER Bots and Crawlers Working Group.
* **Robots, crawlers, bots:** non-human site visitors who may still view and download article data. These are usually identified as such to the server, and OJS does not count them in its usage metrics, as per the Project COUNTER Code of Practice.
