# Statistics

This chapter of the Administrator Guide provides a general overview of usage statistics in Open Journal Systems \(OJS\), and by extension in Open Monograph Press \(OMP\). It contains general usage guidelines for common scenarios suitable for editors and journal managers to use. It also contains a fair bit of technical detail suitable for systems administrators. Where possible we have tried to distinguish between both areas of expertise.

The development of this chapter has been funded by the Government of Canada via a grant from Canadian Heritage, and by the Canadian Association of Learned Journals / Association canadienne des revues savantes. Public Knowledge Project provided additional in-kind assistance towards the development of this project.
